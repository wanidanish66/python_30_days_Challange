# This is a program to demonstrate how to add all elements of a list and return the result.

list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(list) # this will print the list

sum = list[0] + list[1] + list[2] + list[3] + list[4] # this will add all elements of the list and return the result
print(sum) # this will print the result of the addition
