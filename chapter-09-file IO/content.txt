Upon the hill, a quiet ***** stands,
The hardest worker in all these lands.
With ears so long, that ***** ***** hears,
The whispers of the wind throughout the years.
No matter how heavy the load upon its back,
The stubborn ***** stays upon the track.
A gentle soul, this dusty, grey old *****,
Patient as a ***** can ever be.
Children ***** to feed the ***** hay,
And watch the ***** softly walk away.
With a flick of tail, the ***** shares its grace,
A kind and sturdy *****, pace by pace.
Though some may call it "just a *****" low,
The ***** has a secret, quiet glow.
For in the story of the world, it's known,
A special, humble ***** helped the throne.
